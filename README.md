`stint` provides efficient and convenient N-bit integers for Nim, for arbitrary
sizes of `N` decided at compile time with an interface similar to to
`int64`/`uint64`.

In addition to basic integer operations, `stint` also contains primtives for
modular arithmetic, endian conversion, basic I/O, bit twiddling etc.

`stint` integers, like their `intXX`/`uintXX` counterpart in Nim are stack-based
values, meaning that they are naturally allocation-free and have value-based
semantics.

```nim
import stint

func addmul(a, b, c: UInt256): UInt256 =
  a * b + c

echo addmul(u256"100000000000000000000000000000", u256"1", u256"2")
```

## Priorities

- Portability
  - 32 and 64 bit
  - ARM/x86/x86_64 extensively tested
  - Additionally RISC-V and MIPS for open hardware and low power IoT devices.
- Speed, library is carefully tuned to produce the best assembly given the current compilers.
  However, the library itself does not require assembly for portability.
- No heap/dynamic allocation
- Ease of use:
  - Use traditional `+`, `-`, `+=`, etc operators like on native types
  - converting to and from raw byte BigInts (also called octet string in IETF specs)
  - converting to and from Hex
  - converting to and from decimal strings

Non-priorities include:

* constant-time operation (not suitable for certain kinds of cryptography out of the box)
* runtime precision
